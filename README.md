Notes:
You may recieve a "Windows protected your PC" warning. That is a false positive, my script is 100% real and not a virus. 
Feel free to open it in visual studio code, this isn't malicious.
The python file is included in the rest of the github, the file for the .exe is too large. 
If you don't want to use python to install it or you don't have python just download it from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bHIov7PrsZlgB6SD0tYhJeCt1CCCRRwW/view?usp=sharing
